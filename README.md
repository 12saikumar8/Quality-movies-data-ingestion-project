# Quality-movies-data-ingestion-project

In this project, our focus is on ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our data through comprehensive data quality checks. Specifically, we'll be applying a predefined set of validation rules to assess the validity of the IMDb movies rating.csv file, which arrives daily. Upon the file's arrival, an event bridge rule will trigger a notification to a step function. Subsequently, this step function will kick off a crawler to start and execute its task. Once the crawler completes its operation, the step function will then initiate a Glue job. Within this job, thorough data quality checks will be conducted, allowing us to segregate the data based on its quality. This process enables us to determine the appropriate destination for records of both high and low quality. Finally, after the Glue job reads the data from the crawler, the refined dataset will be ingested into the Redshift warehouse for further analysis and utilization.
